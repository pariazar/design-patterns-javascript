The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In JavaScript, it's typically implemented by creating a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns the same instance every time it's called.

Here's a simple implementation:

```javascript
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = this;
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  static getInstance() {
    return Singleton.instance || new Singleton();
  }
}
```

You mostly use the Singleton pattern when you want to ensure there's only one instance of a class and provide a way to access that instance globally. It's handy in scenarios like managing configuration settings, database connections, logging, or any resource that should have a single point of control throughout the application.
