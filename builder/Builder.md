The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

In JavaScript, the Builder Pattern typically involves creating a builder object that contains methods for setting various properties of the object being built. These methods return the builder object itself, enabling method chaining to set multiple properties in a fluent style.

Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Burger {
  constructor() {
    this.bread = '';
    this.meats = 0;
    this.cheese = false;
    this.lettuce = false;
    // Other properties...
  }
}

class BurgerBuilder {
  constructor() {
    this.burger = new Burger();
  }

  withBread(bread) {
    this.burger.bread = bread;
    return this;
  }

  withMeats(count) {
    this.burger.meats = count;
    return this;
  }

  withCheese() {
    this.burger.cheese = true;
    return this;
  }

  withLettuce() {
    this.burger.lettuce = true;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return this.burger;
  }
}

// Usage
const burger = new BurgerBuilder()
  .withBread('Wheat')
  .withMeats(2)
  .withCheese()
  .withLettuce()
  .build();
```

The Builder Pattern is mostly used in scenarios where there are complex objects with many optional parameters, or where the construction process involves multiple steps. It's commonly seen in libraries and frameworks where configuration objects need to be created with a flexible and readable syntax.
